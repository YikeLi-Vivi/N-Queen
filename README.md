# N-Queen Solver Visualizer in Kotlin with Compose

This project is a visualizer and solver for the N-Queens problem, implemented in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle in which you have to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** The visualizer allows you to interactively place queens on the chessboard and see the solutions as you go.
- **Solving Algorithm:** The application uses a backtracking algorithm to find solutions for N-Queens problems.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with Jetpack Compose, the user interface adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Customizable Board Size:** You can select the size of the chessboard and see how the algorithm performs for different N values.
